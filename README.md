This project was developed as part of a university assignment, where I contributed to the UI development for two pagesâ€”the washing machine reservations and the forum, which was built using JavaScript. Additionally, I implemented the email notification script in Python, using a gmail account to send confirmation emails and other user notifications.

# UApp register_login

# API Documentation

This API allows users to register and log in. It supports user registration with a file upload, which is parsed for additional user data (e.g., real name, birthday, gender). It also supports user login by verifying the username and password.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/register_login


## Endpoints

- `password` (string, required): The password for the user.
- `confirm_password` (string, required): The confirmation password for validation.
- `file` (file, required): The file to be uploaded (e.g., an image file). This file will be parsed to extract additional user data.

#### Response

On successful registration, the server responds with a JSON object containing the user data:

- `success`: `true` if the registration was successful.
